# introduction

This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis using a data set collected on crickets.

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

# What is that sound?

In this report, we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate.

```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(crickets)
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 8) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rate of crickets") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```

## Temperature affects chirp rate.

```{r temp, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  ggtitle("Plot of temperature and chirp rate") +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)') +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)')

temp_lm <- lm(rate ~ temp, crickets)

summary.lm(temp_lm)

```

Based on a scatter plot of temperature and chirping and a correlation test, it seems that as temperature increases one degree, the rate of chirping increases about 4.2 chirps per minute.

## Species-specific effects of temperature on chirping

```{r species, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  ggtitle("Plot of temperature and chirp rate for two species of crickets") +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)') +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)')

species_lm <- lm(rate ~ temp + species, crickets)

summary.lm(species_lm)
```
The second graph and model show a more accurate way to predict chirping rates by including the species of cricket. It shows that O. exclamationis chirps 10 more times per minute than O. niveus. The modelâ€™s R-squared value of 0.9896 means it explains 99% of the data, which is much better than the first model (with an R-squared of 0.9199), which only explains 92% of the data. This makes the second model more reliable for predicting chirp rates.
